                <p>
                    Hi,I am Linda.I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early adult life, cooking dinner usually meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from a box. It wasn’t until I got married that I started eating real food because I married a guy who cooks. I started joining him in the kitchen and realized that cooking could be fun. Eating real food was really fun. And gaining confidence as a home chef? That was life changing!

                <p>
                    It’s a food blog, so naturally you’re going to find recipes <br> 
                    But I only share the recipes I really, truly love. You won’t find anything <br> 
                    here that I’ve never made before or would never make again. <br> 
                    Every recipe I post has my stamp of approval—if I wouldn’t <br> 
                    eat it or serve it, you won’t find it here.
